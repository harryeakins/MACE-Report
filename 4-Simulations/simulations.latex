\chapter{Simulations}

\section{System Validation}
\subsection{Simple Simulations}
Peliminary simulations to ensure there are no bugs in the code affecting the results.

\subsection{Sample Data from History}
Data to compare our final results to, to ensure we haven't cocked anything up.

%ASSIGNED TO: Harry, Rob

\section{Simulation Design}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Which setups do we wish to run?},
\item{What emergent behaviour are we planning to explore from this?}
\end{itemize}
