	The genetic representation of the agent to evolve for this particular simulation consists of parameters, its social belief, economic belief, as well as a neural network to allow the agent to learn to choose food to hunt for itself.
	The idea of having a choose food strategy given by a neural network is mainly due to neural networks' ability to be trained to perform in a much more general situation, such that agents with the best neural networks could reason intelligently with its current circumstances.
	The neural network within the agent (Figure~\ref{fig:ga_choose_food}) is a feed forward neural network with 3 distinct layers.
	All neurons within the network are tangent sigmoid functions, all of its parameters are within range $[-1,1]$.
	So as the inputs to the neural network, all values have been normalised to be between -1 and 1.

	\end{figure}

	The choices agents can made are always to hunt either stag or hare.
	The agent's network then base its inputs on what choice his opponent made in the last turn, what mixed strategy over the history did the opponent use---that is the probability of hunting stags, and many other attributes as illustrated in the above figure.
