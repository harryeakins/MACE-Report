\section{Politics and Community}
In a politics simulation, our main goal is to investigate how internal and external 
politics emerge from a group of initially unrelated agents. 
Instead of imposing political systems and behaviours to the agents, we allowed 
them to decide for their own future and thus letting different behaviours to emerge. 
We now discuss the details in which this emergence can occur.

\subsection{Description of the Agent}
Throughout the politics, we use three characteristics to give the best approximation 
of the personality of the agent (loyalty, happiness and trust). 
We had also allowed each agent to adopt a strategy that describes how it will want to 
behave and survive with other agents; primarily a description of their cooperation. 
Alongside the four attributes, each agent is assigned two variables of beliefs of which 
are used to help reflect what the agent will expect from others and from its endeavours 
(economical and social). 
The two beliefs help connect an agent to others (form a group) if such a connection 
would ever exist.

The breakdown of how to describe an agent follows and will be used significantly in the 
politics to follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item Loyalty $\rightarrow$ a group characteristic defining the level of an agents 
dependence to the group
\item Happiness $\rightarrow$ a characteristic used by all agents where it is used 
to motivate them move in and out of a group
\item Trust $\rightarrow$ an agent may become loyal to a group, however, that comes 
from a solid trust with one or more agents
\item Strategy Type $\rightarrow$ would the agent cooperate or not when hunting for food
\item Economic Belief $\rightarrow$ the level of sharing food that an agent believes in
\item Social Belief $\rightarrow$ the level of freedom from authority that an agent believes in
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Structure of the Game}
The following paragraph is just a brief overview of the game structure. 
Details about the structure are given further on. 
The game we refer to here is to go hunting and get lots of food:

\begin{itemize}
\item Initially we start with a pool of free agents.
\item The game is played in pairs. 
A free agent that can't find a pair remains inactive, i.e. doesn't go hunting and loses food.
\item Each agent has a type and hunts according to the strategy defined by its type. 
\item An agent can engage into two actions

\begin{itemize}
\item Either stays as a free agent and plays the game with another free agent (or if there is no pair then stays inactive and loses food). 
\item Or form a coalition with another agent (or group) if there is some sort of benefit for both parties. Details of this formation discussed later.
\end{itemize}

\item In each group a panel of leaders emerge in dependence of social belief of the group 
(only one leader in a dictatorship, to, everyone in the group deciding for what is best). 

\item As the game goes on two kinds of games are played. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The game played by the follower agents inside the group: 
The hunters inside the group form pairs and play the game. 
The food hunted is intercepted by the group and distributed back to the followers according to the economic 
belief of the group. 

\item The game played between leaders: 
Once a panel of leaders has been formed the group is able to play the stag hunt game with other groups. 
As in real situations, group actions and result are much more significant that individual ones therefore, 
the result from the hunting game between the groups is much larger and is proportional to the size of the group.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Here we tried to model two aspects of real life, the followers struggle for survival in the 
group and conflicts between groups of agents (to connect with the real world, between countries 
of agents). 
This is roughly what happens in reality where each person tries to gather food to survive and 
also countries fight or collaborate with other foreign countries.
\end{itemize}

\item After the game (hunting) is over the food gathered is distributed, agent's attributes are 
updated. 
If an agent is a follower (part of a group) it can decide to leave the group if it wishes.
\item Before repeating the procedure agents in the group are allowed to vote for a proposal 
that is made in the group. This proposal has to do with the movement of the group along the 
economical axes which sets the distribution of the food.
\item Also agents rate their leader according to its actions and all agents have their attributes 
updated.
\item We go back to the beginning and start a new game iteration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Politically Oriented Agents and Groups of Agents}
This section proposes a method for dynamically deciding how a group of agents handle their 
economies and social aspects. The political compass is shown below:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figures/socialGraph}
\caption{The Social Graph}
\end{figure}

This is a 2D plane. The x-axis (Left/Right) determines how the group handle their economic 
affairs. 
The y-axis (Authoritarian/Libertarian) determines how rules and laws are enforced.

A group that is towards the left side of the x-axis will tend towards distributing resources 
evenly throughout the group. 
A group that is towards the right side of the x-axis is less likely to evenly distribute resources 
and individual agents will likely keep most of the resources they earn.

A group towards the authoritarian half of the y-axis will have rules set by leader(s) that are 
heavily enforced. Orders set by the leader(s) of a group towards the libertarian half of the 
y-axis can be seen more as guidelines opposed to commandments.

What we employ is that each agent has two attributes assigned with random values. 
These attributes are used to determine the position of the agent’s beliefs on the political 
compass.
 

\centerline{\textbf{Agent Attributes: economic\_belief (x-axis), social\_belief (y-axis)}}
 

Each group will also have these two attributes and this comes from how agents decide to form groups among themselves.
 

\centerline{\textbf{Group Attributes: group\_economic\_belief (x-axis), group\_social\_belief (y-axis)}}
 

\subsection{Forming a Coalition}
In real life individual agents can interact with other agents and decide if they can form a coalition. 
A coalition might increase the individual’s utility due to the trust shared between its members. 
For a political agent or group we consider two factors as important when assessing the possibility 
of forming or joining a coalition. 
The first one is the mutual trust between the two parties and the second one is the similarity of their socio-economic beliefs.

\subsubsection{Trust}
Each present agent will hold a trust value (in the form of a percentage, in fact all attributes 
discussed here are used as percentages) for each and every other agent. 
Now, in the beginning, since no one has met anyone else or interacted with them, trust values 
are initialised to null. We use this to show that Agent X has never met Agent Y.

To kick things off, random pairs of agents occur to play a beneficial game of hunting. 
It has to be beneficial because the food that is returned to them must meet their demands. 
Their demands come from the percentage of their economic belief; this belief tells us how much 
food an agent expects to receive. If it got what it wanted then trust for the other agent starts to grow.

We not only update trust after a hunt, but, also after voting for any proposal; but, that only occurs 
within groups because we need a proposer to propose a proposal and a proposer is a group idea in
 which other agents trust one another so that they can communicate with one another so that they 
can better their situation as a group.

\subsubsection{Socio-Economical}
We made use of the political compass shown below:

From `Right' to `Left' we discuss the economic affairs that are believed by an agent; should food 
be distributed evenly across the group or should an agent keep the food it gets?
From `Authoritarian' to `Libertarian' we discuss the social affairs that are believed by an agent; 
should an agent be free and act under no command or should it give/follow strict orders?
So, there are two attributes to be assigned to each agent which describe their position in the 
political compass:

\subsection{Economic $ \in ( 0 \% - 100 \% )$}

If believing in the very `Right', 100\%, the agent believes in keeping the resources they earn 
for themselves. 
If believing in the very `Left', 0\%, the agent believes in distributing resources evenly, sharing,
 throughout a potential group.

\subsection{Social $ \in  ( 0 \% - 100 \% ) $}

If believing in the very `Authoritarian', 0\%, the agent believes heavily in giving orders and 
enforcing punishment for neglecting those orders. 
If believing in the very `Libertarian', 100\%, the agent believes in being free from any orders 
or enforcement.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/detailed_social_graph}
\end{figure}

The above diagram shows an estimate of how the political groups of today are spread out on 
the political compass. 
We can use the above and the agent's economic and social beliefs to describe their political view.
Finding the distribution of our agents grouping among themselves can be useful in evaluation; 
would it always be the case an agent who is initially democratic become communist given a particular
personality (happiness, trust etc.)?

\subsubsection{To Group or Not to Group}
Initially, when trying to form coalitions (groups of agents), it is essential for two agents to have 
a certain degree of trust. 
After hunting amongst each other, the agents gain trust for each other regardless of their socio-economic beliefs. 
When deciding whether to create a group or not, belief is considered less significant than trust. 
It is only when a group is formed that an agent from the ‘outside’ would require similar beliefs to 
the group as a whole in order to join.
For a group responding to an agent's request to join, trust matters but is not as important as having similar
political beliefs.

%TODO: IMAGE GOES HERE

The way we compute similar beliefs is through the vector distance on the political compass. 
The closer they are, the better to group with.

When trying to form a possible group, both parties must be in agreement; both agents must 
agree to form groups or both an agent and a group must agree to form a larger group.

\subsection{How to get a Leader}
\subsubsection{A Leader in General}
Leadership emerges from a group of agents and depends on the mutual trust between its members.
Leadership is an emerging norm in a group and the types and number of leaders is defined by the
current attributes of the group. 
For the analysis of leadership we only consider the y-axis of the political compass.

In order to proceed with the analysis of leadership we first need to define the notion of the panel 
of leaders.  
The panel is the set of agents that are entitled to make decisions for the group. 
The panel size is determined by the social belief of the group. 
Groups that tend towards the authoritarian side of the axis will have smaller panels. 
A group on the top of the axis is essentially a dictatorship and the panel consists of a single agent, 
the dictator. Groups that are at the bottom of the axis will have larger panels. 
The members of the panel are the agents that are trusted more by any other agent in the group.

\subsubsection{How Do Leaders Emerge}
A leader is an agent who is trusted by all the other agents in a group. 
An agent gains the trust of its fellow agents by cooperating with them in the stag hunt game or by 
being able to make accurate predictions for them. 
When an agent which is about to go hunting asks another agent for advice on the strategy to be followed. 
An advisor able to make a correct prediction, i.e. helping the asker to increase its profit, gains 
the trust of that agent. 
Therefore, over time some agents will become more trusted than others and thus eligible to join 
the panel. 

\subsubsection{Decision Making}
As was mentioned above, two kinds of games are played. 
The first game is the one between the leaders of different groups and the other one is the game 
played by the members of the group. 
The game between the leaders model international conflicts and the game within the group, models 
the people's effort for social and individual welfare within the group. 
The panel is responsible for deciding the strategies for these two games. 
The decision for the internal game is implicitly made since the members of the panel advise their
followers to follow the optimal strategy by predicting their opponents' strategy. 
Being able to make accurate predictions is what led certain agent to be in the panel in the first place. 

The decision for the external game is more complex and must take into account the followers' 
opinions (preferred strategies based on their types). 
The weighting of the followers' opinions varies depending on the position of the group on the 
political compass. 
Groups at the authoritarian side of the compass give a small if no weighting to their followers' 
opinion. 
On the other side, libertarian groups seek for high support from their followers before deciding 
the group's strategy. 
In order to enable the panel to make decisions we introduced the notion of the quotum. 
The quotum is the minimum number of supporters a proposal requires to be accepted. 
The higher the quotum, the harder is to get a proposal accepted. 
Therefore, authoritarian groups have smaller quotum while libertarian groups are essentially unable 
to make any decision since the quotum is too high.

\subsubsection{Maintaining the Power}
When an agent becomes eligible to join the panel its trust value is checked against a threshold. 
If the agent's trust is above the threshold it can become a member of the panel. 
In each round we reassess each member's trust to see if it can still be a member of the panel. 
Therefore, the threshold acts as an incentive for the leaders to make good decisions. 
A bad decision is punished by the followers by decreasing the trust value for all the members of 
the panel. 
This threshold is calculated based on the social belief of the group. 
Authoritarian groups have lower threshold and libertarian ones higher. 
Therefore, an authoritarian panel has to worry less when making a decision than a libertarian panel.

\subsection{Where to go from here}
Once we have a stable group or during the formation of the groups, we want to use what has 
emerged and bring things into perspective, via extending the political world described above. 
The point we moved on to analyse is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Whether or not charities and loans should be given between groups (which we are treating 
as countries). 
We want to know whether giving money (food will be thought as money) to another can exist.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Economics and Loans}
\subsubsection{Should we give a Loan?}
To answer the question above, we abstracted away any concrete sense of politics and concentrated 
on the interaction of groups and to let them decide if they need help from prosperous groups or if 
they should provide help to the needy groups. 
What is kept from the political world are the way agents in a group decide on a strategy to hunt food 
and to distribute food, updating the agents trust and happiness after a hunt and choosing a group is 
now random because this assessment concentrates on group interaction (note that it can be easily 
done to force agents to group heuristically). 

From the group perspective, there is many additions along with removal of ideas used in the very 
political world. 
To follow on that agents group randomly, a group will always accept the agent into its group, again, 
to concentrate more on the interaction between groups. Groups still maintain and update a panel 
of leaders, or a leader, with the trust assessment deriving from hunting. What comes with the panel 
is the ability for groups to choose the most favourable strategy to use in the external game (the 
hunting game between groups). That leaves the additions for which groups interact and give/take 
loans.

\subsubsection{Making Payments}
To help out the idea of the loaning/charity system, we introduced the idea groups making payments 
to primarily lose ‘money’. 
There are a few constant to be known first. 
There is the group’s reserve, it is the amount of food that the group has ownership of and is 
accumulated from taxing the citizens of the group, we treat the food the group has (the reserve) and 
the food that the agents have as their possession of money. 
There is the price to play constant that simply informs the group how much is needed to play the
 hunting game with each other. 
There is also the achievement constant, its sole purpose provides the motivation for a group to 
move forward in its life, it is the amount of food/money a group wants to attain for any arbitrary 
purpose a country would have (going to space, getting a piece of research, world domination, etc.). 
And, lastly, the greediness constant (assigned randomly to each group) basically informs us how 
greedy a group is for money.

When making payments, a group firstly checks if it has a decent amount of money to play the 
hunting game with other groups; if everything is ok then the required amount of deduction is made 
from the group’s reserve, otherwise the group does not play and sits this turn out. 
The next payment is to public service. 
The groups who are greedy the most will have high probability to spend money from the reserve into 
an arbitrary definition of public service (schools, roads, statues, etc.). 
They would pay just enough as to not strive too much away from attaining achievement and to 
satisfy the happiness of the citizens; groups with a low greediness factor can still pay for public 
service but are less likely to do so. 
The last and most important payment to be made is to repay any loans a group has with the 
interest decided by the loaner. This is where a group clears its debts.

\subsubsection{Taxing for the Reserve}
After the internal game is played (where agents in a group hunt with each other to get food), the 
shared food that is needed to be distributed throughout the group members is intercepted and 
taxed for the benefit of the group. 
But, before taxing, the group firstly retrieves any money (food) that a person in need has paid back 
with interest. 
After this is accounted for in the reserve, the shared pool is taxed to add on top of whatever is left 
of the reserve; the rest of the shared pool is then fed back for distribution amongst the members 
of the group.

The way the shared pool is taxed is by checking if the group is in desperate need of money then 
they tax high, this is done by looking at how far away the group is from attaining achievement.
 Otherwise, if things are going well for the group, the taxing is done in the same way but includes 
how happy the members are. 
If unhappy then don’t tax too much, if happy then tax but don’t take advantage of your members.

\subsubsection{Interacting for the Loan}
At the start of each turn a group checks its financial status and requests for help if needed; 
this decision is done by checking the reserve at its current state and looking for a decreasing trend 
in its history.
If the group is in need, it first checks to see if it still requires a loan (a group may be in trouble for 
many turns as nobody replies to its pleas, however the group in trouble might be able to bounce 
back on its own) and if it does, checks to see if any group has given it a loan for the amount of 
money that it needs (which, in this world, maximises to the price needed to play at least two 
hunting games with other groups). 
If no one has, the group goes on with its day trying to survive, but, if someone has then the reserve 
is updated with the amount it needed and the group stores a record in its history notifying that it 
has to pay this certain group back eventually.
The group may not be in need and for this case the group looks for other desperate groups that 
are looking for money. 
Assessing each group in order from the neediest, if that needy group has not already accepted a 
loan and this group has the money to help the needy then the loan is given with the amount that 
the needy requires along with knowledge of the interest rate. 
The interest rate is computed by the sum of how greedy the group that is loaning (this is given a 
low weighting because even if this is charity the loaner still retains its greedy nature) and how far 
away the needy group is from attaining achievement, which is never above the price to play the 
game and because of that, the interest rate stays within possible values below 20\%

\subsection{Helper Plugins}
In order to simulate our agents we basically used Presage. 
This tool allowed us to create our own plugins in order to evaluate the agents, the groups created 
and the interactions happening throughout the simulation. 
These plugins are described below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Political Compass:
This is most important tool of the simulation as it shows what is happening at each iteration. 
The agents are represented as dots with their strategies attached and are located according to 
their economic and social beliefs on the compass.
The lines represent the connections (Groups) between the agents and each group is coloured 
differently. 
When a panel of leaders is created then these agents are distinguished by painting them in black. 
Using the compass you can comprehend what is happening in the group; which of the agents join 
or leave the group, and also see how the group as a whole moves along the axes when proposals 
are happening.

\item Hunter Logs:
The plugin displays all the created agents along with their attributes held by the simulation. 
These are: name, strategy, group, if it is a leader or not, if it is alive or not, its food amount, 
economic and social belief, loyalty, happiness and the last hunted food.

\item Group Logs:
The plugin displays the attributes of the groups which exist at each instant in the system. 
Attributes displayed are: the name, its size, the economic and social belief (taken from its agents), 
the average loyalty, happiness and food of the agents in the group and also displays the leaders of 
the group which consist of the agents in the “panel”.

\item Group Graphs:
The plugin displays 5 graphs of all the groups which ever existed in the current simulation.
These graphs show the economic, social, average food, loyalty and happiness of the agents in the 
group in respect to the time of the simulation. 
From these graphs you can see which attributes played important role for a group to dominate 
and increase its population or disappear.

\item:Group Agent info:
The plugin displays all the “special” agents which represent the groups along with their attributes 
held by the simulation and also attributes derived from the agents in the particular group. 
These are: name, strategy, group, if it is alive or not, its food amount, economic and social belief, 
loyalty, happiness and the last hunted food. 

\item:Loans info: 
This plugin provides real time information about the current status of each group in terms of loans 
taken or given. In the end of the simulation the plugin summarizes the results in tabular form. 
\end{itemize}
