\subsection{Distributed Politics Simulations}

A number of simulations were run, for a variety of different builds, using
the PoliticxExtended simulation, listed in extract \ref{pol-ext} on page
\pageref{pol-ext}.

After the failures of the Condor-driven simulations, we fell back analysing
these data sets, which are non-determisnitcally geenrated, but are avialable
to view at \url{isegol.com/result.html}.
Any specific simulations are referred to by their id number, displayed in
the left hand sid scroll bar as part of the graph.
The simulations we consider here are primarily built and run using build
ecfdc8\footnote{

}.

The continued use fo all four straegies shows up as a major 

\subsubsection{Loaning and Greediness}

Greedier groups tend to borrow more, less greedy more generous.
Benefit to greddy groups who don't need to pay back?

\subsubsection{Group Behaviour}

All of the simulations led to the formation of groups.
This could be taken to indicate that the framework has an unfair bias towards
grouping, but similar patterns are also seen in life.
We form groups as family, tribes, communities, and civilisations in order to
aid our survivial.

The groups that were formed varied in size from just two agents all the way 
into the twenties - a significant portion of the initial eighty agents.
The overall the 

A variety of different intersting points can be taken from the different
simulations. The first Simualtion that we shall analysis is 2312.

\subsubsection{Analysis of Simulation 2312}

2312 consisted primarily of Always Cooperate agents, meaning that very few
of the agents died whislt it was running. 
Very early on, a large goup forms between the `Democracy' and `Communism' zones,
which drifts slowly right over the course of simulation.
However, on closer examination, some interesting things are happening around
this group - there are a large number of other small groups forming at different
points around the compass.
Some of these groups die out rather quickly, leading to the slight declines in
population, but a number survive through to the end of the simulation.

  \subfloat[30\%]{\label{2312-30}\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{figures/2312-30}}
  \subfloat[50\%]{\label{2312-50}\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{figures/2312-50}}
  \subfloat[70\%]{\label{2312-70}\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{figures/2312-70}}
  \subfloat[100\%]{\label{2312-100}\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{figures/2312-100}}
\end{figure}

These groups, made of many co-operating agents, model a world that is notably
more ideal than our own.
The behaviours of these groups partially represent this - the tiny community
pairs don't move about the compass anywhere near as much as the large group.

Furthermore, there are some interestnig arefacts that form around the large
group.
The 50\% still, shown in figure \ref{2312-50} has a new group forming
exactly underneath the main group.
This behaviour is also seen in the 100\% still (figure \ref{2312-100}).
This is caused by a number of agents simultaneously leaving the group due to
a lack of happiness, cuasing them to leave the group.
As their beliefs are centered on the group already, they form a new splinter
faction at almost exactly the same place.
In much the same way as a border province breaking of from a major country,
a number of different things may happen.
The first of these is that the group survives and lives a happy life of its
own; the groups formed in the 50\% frame move rapidly away from autorcracy.
If they had not been able to maintain happiness levels, they may have been
re-intergrated into the major group.
The third option that is liekly to occurr in other simulations is that a
small splinter gorup is unable to support itself due to betrayal between the
agents.
